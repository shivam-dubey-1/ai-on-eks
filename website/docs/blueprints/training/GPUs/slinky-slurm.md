# Slurm on EKS

:::warning
Deployment of ML models on EKS requires access to GPUs or Neuron instances. If your deployment isn't working, it’s often due to missing access to these resources. Also, some deployment patterns rely on Karpenter autoscaling and static node groups; if nodes aren't initializing, check the logs for Karpenter or Node groups to resolve the issue.
:::

### What is Slurm?

[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) is an open-source, highly scalable workload manager and job scheduler designed for managing compute resources on compute clusters of all sizes. It provides three core functions: allocating access to compute resources, providing a framework for launching and monitoring parallel computing jobs, and managing queues of pending work to resolve resource contention.

Slurm is widely used in AI training to manage and schedule large-scale, GPU-accelerated workloads across high-performance computing clusters. It allows researchers and engineers to efficiently allocate computing resources, including CPUs, GPUs and memory, enabling distributed training of deep learning models and large language models by spanning jobs across many nodes with fine-grained control over resource types and job priorities. Slurm’s reliability, advanced scheduling features, and integration with both on-premise and cloud environments make it a preferred choice for handling the scale, throughput, and reproducibility that modern AI research and industry demand.

### What is the Slinky Project?

The [Slinky Project](https://github.com/SlinkyProject) is an open-source suite of integration tools designed by [SchedMD](https://www.schedmd.com/) (the lead developers of Slurm) to bring Slurm capabilities into Kubernetes, combining the best of both worlds for efficient resource management and scheduling. The Slinky Project includes a [Kubernetes operator for Slurm clusters](https://github.com/SlinkyProject/slurm-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#kubernetes-operator-for-slurm-clusters), which implements [custom-controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers) and [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) to manage the lifecycle of Slurm Cluster and NodeSet resources deployed within a Kubernetes environment.

This Slurm cluster includes the following components:
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Controller (slurmctld) | The central management daemon that monitors resources, accepts jobs, and assigns work to compute nodes. |
| Accounting (slurmdbd) | Handles job accounting and user/project management through a MariaDB database backend. |
| Compute (slurmd) | The worker nodes that execute jobs, organized into NodeSets which can be grouped into different partitions. |
| Login | Provides SSH access points for users to interact with the Slurm cluster and submit jobs. |
| REST API (slurmrestd) | Offers HTTP-based API access to Slurm functionality for programmatic interaction with the cluster. |
| Authentication (sackd) | Manages credential authentication for secure access to Slurm services. |
| MariaDB | The database backend used by the accounting service to store job, user, and project information. |
| Prometheus Service Monitor | Configured within the controller to scrape metrics from scheduler, partition, node, and job endpoints for monitoring purposes. |

When paired with Amazon EKS, the Slinky Project unlocks the ability for enterprises who have standardized infrastructure management on Kubernetes to deliver a Slurm-based experience to their ML scientists. It also enables training, experimentation, and inference to happen on the same cluster of accelerated nodes.

### Slurm on EKS Architecture

![alt text](../img/Slurm-on-EKS.png)

The diagram above depicts the Slurm on EKS deployment outlined in this guide. An Amazon EKS cluster acts as an orchestration layer, with core Slurm Cluster components hosted on a managed node group of m6i.xlarge instances, while a Karpenter NodePool manages the deployment of GPU accelerated compute nodes for the slurmd pods to run on. The Slinky Slurm operator and Slurm cluster are automatically deployed as ArgoCD applications.

The login LoadBalancer type service is annotated to dynamically create an AWS Network Load Balancer using the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller), allowing ML scientists to SSH into the login pod without interfacing with the Kubernetes API server via kubectl.

The login and slurmd pods also have an [Amazon FSx for Lustre](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/) shared filesystem mounted. Having containerized slurmd pods allows many dependencies that would traditionally be installed manually using Conda or a Python virtual environment to be baked into the container image, but shared filesystems are still beneficial for storing training artifacts, data, logs, and checkpoints.

### Key Features and Benefits

- Run Slurm workloads side by side with containerized Kubernetes applications on the same infrastructure. Both Slurm and Kubernetes workloads can be scheduled on the same node pools, increasing utilization and avoiding resource fragmentation.
- Manage both Slurm jobs and Kubernetes pods seamlessly, leveraging familiar tooling from both ecosystems without sacrificing control or performance.
- Dynamically add or removes compute nodes in response to workload demand, autoscaling allocated resources efficiently, handling spikes and lulls in demand to reduce infrastructure costs and idle resource waste.
- High-availability through Kubernetes orchestration. If a controller or worker pod fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts it, reducing manual intervention.
- Slurm’s sophisticated scheduling features (fair-share allocation, dependency management, priority scheduling) are integrated into Kubernetes, maximizing compute utilization and aligning resources with workload requirements.
- Slurm and its dependencies are deployed as containers, ensuring consistent deployments across environments. This reduces configuration drift and streamlines dev-to-prod transitions.
- Users can build Slurm images tailored to specialized needs (e.g., custom dependencies, libraries), promoting consistency and repeatability in scientific or regulated environments.
- Administrators can define custom Slurm clusters and node sets directly using Kubernetes Custom Resources, including partitioning compute nodes for different types of jobs (e.g., stable vs. opportunistic/backfill partitions)
- Slinky integrates with monitoring stacks for both Slurm and Kubernetes, providing robust metrics and visualization for administrators and users.

<CollapsibleContent header={<h2><span>Deploying the Solution</span></h2>}>

In this example, you will provision a Slinky Slurm cluster on Amazon EKS.

**0. Prerequisites:**

Ensure that you have installed the following tools on your machine.

1. [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
2. [kubectl](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
3. [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
4. [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
5. [helm](https://helm.sh/)

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/ai-on-eks.git
```

:::info
If you are using profile for authentication
set your `export AWS_PROFILE="<PROFILE_name>"` to the desired profile name
:::

**2. Review and customize configurations:**

- Check available addons in `infra/base/terraform/variables.tf`
- Modify addon settings in `infra/slinky-slurm/terraform/blueprint.tfvars` as needed.

**3. Review the slurmd container image build automation:**

By default, the `blueprints/training/slinky-slurm/install.sh` script will trigger setup steps to automatically build a new slurmd container image using the `blueprints/training/slinky-slurm/dlc-slurmd.Dockerfile`, which builds on top of an [AWS Deep Learning Container (DLC)](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers) to include Python 3.12.8 + PyTorch 2.6.0 + CUDA 12.6 + NCCL 2.23.4 + EFA Installer 1.38.0 (bundled with OFI NCCL plugin) pre-installed in the container image.

It will then create a new ECR repository and push this image to the repository. If not already present on your machine, a new SSH key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_slurm` will be created for Slurm login pod access as well.

The image repository URI, image tag, and public SSH key are then used to generate a new `slurm-values.yaml` file based on the `blueprints/training/slinky-slurm/slurm-values.yaml.template` file to be used in the deployment of the Slurm cluster.

To customize this behavior, you can add the following optional flags:
| Component | Description | Default Value|
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|`--repo-name`| The name of the ECR repository |dlc-slurmd|
|`--tag`|The image tag |25.11.1-ubuntu24.04|
|`--region`| The AWS region of your ECR repository | inferred from the AWS CLI configuration or set to `us-west-2`|
|`--skip-build`| Set if using an existing image already in ECR | `false`|
|`--skip-setup`| Set if you previously generate a `blueprints/training/slinky-slurm/slurm-values.yaml` file |`false`|
|`--help`| View flag options |`false`|

For example, if you've already built and pushed a custom slurmd container image to a custom ECR repository, add the following flags and values:
```bash
cd ai-on-eks/blueprints/training/slinky-slurm
./install.sh --repo-name dlc-slurmd --tag 25.11.1-ubuntu24.04 --skip-build
```
The script will then validate that the container image exists in your ECR repo before proceeding.

If you wish to use a custom Dockerfile, simply overwrite the contents of the `blueprints/training/slinky-slurm/dlc-slurmd.Dockerfile` before executing `blueprints/training/slinky-slurm/install.sh`.

If you wish to build and push your container image without triggering a Terraform deployment, you can also run the `blueprints/training/slinky-slurm/setup.sh` script directly using the same flags. This script will also generate a new `blueprints/training/slinky-slurm/slurm-values.yaml` file for you.

**4. Trigger deployment:**

Navigate into the `slinky-slurm` directory and run `install.sh` script:
```bash
cd ai-on-eks/blueprints/training/slinky-slurm
./install.sh
```

If Karpenter is unable to find 4 on-demand or spot instances, you may need to make adjustment to the batch training script, then upload a new copy to your provisioned S3 bucket, which will sync it to the FSx for Lustre file system via a [data repository association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/create-dra-linked-data-repo.html):
```
cd ../../../infra/slinky-slurm/terraform/_LOCAL
S3_BUCKET_NAME=$(terraform output -raw fsx_s3_bucket_name)
cd ../../../../blueprints/training/slinky-slurm
aws s3 cp llama2_7b-training.sbatch s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}/
```
:::

Copy the `llama2_7b-training.sbatch` batch training script into the FSDP for Slurm example directory:
```
cp /fsx/data/llama2_7b-training.sbatch ./llama2_7b-training.sbatch
```
**1. Configure Hugging Face Access Token:**

Create a new [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) read [user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to stream the [allenai/c4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/c4) dataset without throttling.

Inject the new Hugging Face token into the training script:
```
NEW_TOKEN="<you-token-here>"
```
```
sed -i "s/export HF_TOKEN=.*$/export HF_TOKEN=$NEW_TOKEN/" llama2_7b-training.sbatch
```
**2. Configure DataLoader for Containerized Environment:**

When running in this Kubernetes-based Slurm setup, the DataLoader needs to use spawn-based multiprocessing instead of the default fork method. This ensures proper CUDA initialization within the containerized worker processes. For this, we'll add `multiprocessing_context='spawn'` to the DataLoader defined in the `train_utils.py` file.

```
sed -i "s/timeout=600)/timeout=600, multiprocessing_context='spawn')/" ../src/model_utils/train_utils.py
```
**3. Start the training job:**

Submit the batch training script to the Slurm Controller using the [sbatch](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) command:
```
sbatch llama2_7b-training.sbatch
```
```
Submitted batch job 1
```
**4. Monitor trianing progess:**

Watch the output logs from the login pod:
```
export JOB_ID=$(squeue -h -u root -o "%i" | head -1)

tail -f logs/llama2_7b-FSDP_${JOB_ID}.out
```
```
